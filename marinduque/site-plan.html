      <p>
        Throughout the island, there are barangays which are small territories which have their own local government. 
        Over the course of the year, barangays have fiestas where people celebrate with families and friends, and eat food at different homes. 
        In the morning, the Catholic church holds a mass as the start of the day before the fiesta starts. 
        One barangay in Torrijos called Poctoy celebrates its fiesta on January 15.
