            <p>There are many things to do on Marinduque. Plenty of beaches that are all over the island, caves, hot springs, and a growing tourism 
                industry with plenty of options for places to stay in. There also some historic sites on the island. The biggest industry is agriculture 
                primarily growing rice and coconuts. Butterfly farming is also another ongoing industry. </p>

            <p class="paragraph" id="beach">Barangay Poctoy is famous for Poctoy White Beach. It is a beautiful white sanded beach, with many activates available. 
                Kayaking, snorkeling, basking under the sun, and camping are some examples that you can do. Plenty of restaurants are available where freshly 
                caught seafood can be ordered and cooked on the spot for you to get something to eat while at there. There is a reef off the coast of the beach 
                for you to see plenty of aquatic life.</p>

            <p class="paragraph" id="moriones_festival">The island is mainly Christian with many denominations that reside. Catholic, Iglesia ni Cristo, and 
                The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to name a few. During Holy Week, the entire island is known for the Moriones Festival. It is 
                when the locals dress up as Roman Soldiers and parade around their main towns. An reenactment of Longinus, the blind soldier who punctured 
                Jesus Christ with a spear has his vision restored from droplets of blood due to the wound.</p>
