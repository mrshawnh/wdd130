    <h2>Shawn Henrie Jr.</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Shawn and I am pursuing a Software Development degree. I recently moved to the United States a few months ago from the Philippines.</p>
    <p>I love playing basketball, and to learn new things. I also enjoy going to the beach. Right now, I am currently looking for a job to help me get through school.</p>
    <p>I served a mission in San Diego, California. My favorite scripture can be found in Mosiah 4:16.</p>
    <p>"And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; 
        ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need;
        and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, 
        and turn him out to perish."</p>
